# FairScan
An Ontology-Driven Resume Screening Framework for Bias-Free, Context-Autonomous Recruitment

🚀 Overview
Fairscan revolutionizes AI-powered resume screening by eliminating external biases and ensuring complete organizational context autonomy. Unlike traditional systems that rely on generic pre-trained models, Fairscan leverages semantic reasoning and organization-specific ontologies to provide transparent, interpretable, and contextually relevant candidate evaluations.

✨ Key Features

🎯 Bias-Free Screening: Eliminates external biases from pre-trained models
🏢 Organizational Autonomy: Operates entirely within your infrastructure
🧠 Cache Augmented Generation: Novel CAG methodology for efficient semantic processing
📊 SBERT Integration: Advanced semantic similarity matching
⚡ KV Cache Optimization: Fast ontology-driven context retrieval
🔒 Privacy-First: Complete data sovereignty with no external dependencies
📊 Transparent Decisions: Interpretable screening results with clear reasoning
⚙️ Customizable Ontologies: HR-defined contexts for job requirements and cultural values

🎯 Problem Solved
Traditional AI resume screening systems face three critical challenges:

Bias Propagation: Inherit irrelevant biases from external training datasets
Privacy Vulnerabilities: Risk exposure of sensitive candidate information
Context Misalignment: Fail to capture organization-specific requirements and values

Fairscan addresses these issues through semantic knowledge representation that accurately captures and utilizes organization-specific hiring contexts.
